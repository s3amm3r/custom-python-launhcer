# Custom Python Minecraft Launcher

This project aims to build a production-quality, fully custom, open-source Minecraft launcher in Python that rivals third-party launchers like Prism Launcher, MultiMC, or ATLauncher in terms of features, polish, and ease of use. The launcher will be written entirely in Python, prioritizing stability, correctness, maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility over rapid initial development.

## Existing Open-Source Python Launchers Analysis

Before diving into the roadmap, let's review existing Python-based launchers to decide whether to build upon them:

### PyLauncher (https://github.com/amskv/PyLauncher)
- A basic launcher with simple authentication and launch capabilities.
- Pros: Pure Python, straightforward code, supports basic Modrinth mod download.
- Cons: Limited version support (only recent versions), no mod loader integration beyond basic downloads, minimal UI (console/Tkinter), lacks offline mode, Microsoft auth, or asset management.
- Verdict: Not suitable as a base. It's too basic and lacks core features like full authentication, version management, and mod loaders. Starting fresh allows for better architecture and full control.

### MineLaunch (https://github.com/Liam-Boyle/MineLaunch)
- An older project with basic Mojang auth and launch.
- Cons: Unmaintained, only Mojang auth (pre-Microsoft transition), no mod support, minimal features.
- Verdict: Too outdated and limited; not a good foundation.

### mclauncher-api wrappers (e.g., mcla.py)
- Lightweight wrappers around Mojang's mclauncher-api.
- Pros: Handles basic auth and version retrieval.
- Cons: No UI, no asset handling, no mod loaders; very low-level.
- Verdict: Could be used as a component for version/auth handling, but insufficient alone. Better to build custom implementations for more control and features.

**Decision**: Start fresh to ensure modularity, extensibility, and full feature parity with mature launchers. We can borrow concepts from these but not code.

## 1. High-Level Architecture

The launcher will follow a modular, event-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Key Modules
- **auth/**: Handles all authentication (Microsoft OAuth, Mojang legacy, offline mode).
- **versions/**: Manages version manifests, asset downloads, library resolution.
- **instances/**: Profiles/instances management, configuration (JVM args, mods, etc.).
- **modloaders/**: Support for Forge, Fabric, etc.; installation and integration.
- **runtime/**: Java runtime discovery and management.
- **ui/**: Main user interface components.
- **core/**: Core launcher logic (launch process, classpath assembly).
- **updater/**: Self-updater for the launcher.
- **utils/**: Common utilities (async HTTP, file operations, logging).

### Async vs Sync Design
- Use asyncio for all network operations (downloads, auth API calls) to prevent UI blocking.
- Synchronous operations for local file I/O and quick computations.
- Event-driven UI updates to reflect async progress (download progress bars, auth status).

### Cross-Platform Considerations
- Abstract OS-specific paths (e.g., %APPDATA%/.minecraft on Windows, ~/.minecraft on Unix).
- Library loading: Use sys.platform for runtime decisions; provide platform-specific binaries.
- UI: Cross-platform library with native handles (more on this below).

## 2. Recommended Tech Stack

- **Python Version**: 3.8+ (for async/await and pathlib; supports Windows 7+, but aim for 3.10+ for better performance and type hints).
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt6 (PySide6 alternative for Qt licensing if needed). Justification: Modern, highly customizable, true cross-platform with near-native look-and-feel (better than CustomTkinter's synth look). Toga is promising but less mature; Flet is web-based and overkill; Eel is hacky and not polished. Trade-off: PyQt isn't "perfect native" (e.g., macOS Big Sur style), but it's the best Python option for responsive, native-feeling apps. Possible workaround: Custom CSS stylization for theming.
- **Packaging**: poetry or setuptools for dependency management; ensure reproducible builds.

## 3. Best Libraries/Packages

Use actively maintained packages (check GitHub stars, last commit, PyPI downloads):

- **HTTP/Networking**: aiohttp (async HTTP for downloads/auth); requests (simpler for non-async needs).
- **Authentication**: msal-python (Microsoft Authentication Library for OAuth); pyoauth2 (for legacy Mojang). Custom implementation for Xbox Live token handling.
- **Version Parsing**: Custom JSON parsing (version.json); use pydantic for structured data models.
- **Asset Handling**: aiofiles (async I/O for large downloads); hashlib for SHA1 verification.
- **Database**: JSON-based for simplicity (e.g., accounts.json); sqlite3 for instances if scaling up.
- **Mod Loaders/Modpacks**: requests for CurseForge/Modrinth APIs; zipfile/patool for MRPack extraction.
- **Logging**: Standard logging module with RotatingFileHandler.
- **Threading/Async**: asyncio/trio (for UI integration with PyQt).
- **Security**: keyring (secure token storage); cryptography (for any encryption needs).
- **Build**: PyInstaller for distribution; qasync for PyQt + asyncio integration.

Avoid deprecated packages like cryptography<3.0 or urllib3 ancient versions.

## 4. Detailed Authentication Flow

Supports Microsoft (primary), Mojang (legacy), and offline mode.

### Microsoft OAuth Flow (using msal-python)
1. Initiate device code flow: Call `/devicecode` endpoint via aiohttp.
2. Display code and URL to user (UI component).
3. Poll for token: Call `/token` until received (handle rate limiting).
4. Authenticate with Xbox Live: POST to `https://user.auth.xboxlive.com/user/authenticate` with RpsTicket (access token).
5. Authenticate with XSTS: POST to `https://xsts.auth.xboxlive.com/xsts/authorize`.
6. Authenticate with Minecraft: POST to `https://api.minecraftservices.com/authentication/login_with_xbox`.
7. Store refresh token securely via keyring; refresh automatically on launch.

Example (pseudocode):
```python
import msal
import asyncio

app = msal.PublicClientApplication(CLIENT_ID, authority=AUTHORITY)
flow = app.initiate_device_flow(SCOPES)
# Display flow['message'] to user
result = await asyncio.run_in_executor(None, app.acquire_token_by_device_flow, flow)
if result:
    # Extract tokens, store in keyring
    refresh_token = result['refresh_token']
```

For legacy Mojang: Use Yggdrasil API with password hashing.

Offline: Username only, no auth.

Skin/Cape: Fetch from `https://api.minecraftservices.com/minecraft/profile` using Bearer token.

## 5. Version Manifest and Asset Handling Strategy

- Fetch launcher_meta.json from `https://launchermeta.mojang.com/mc/game/version_manifest.json`.
- Parse for version types (release, snapshot, old-beta, etc.); cache locally with ETags.
- For selected version, download version.json; extract:
  - Downloads: client/server JAR URLs and hashes.
  - Libraries: Rules-based filtering (OS, arch, Java version); ensure natives are extracted per platform.
  - Assets: Download assetIndex.json, then parallel download of assets (objects/*) with SHA1 verification.
- Handle rules: JSONPath-like evaluation (e.g., os.name == 'windows'); skip incompatible libs.
- Caching: Use .minecraft/assets and libraries/; invalidate on hash mismatch.
- Progress: Async downloads with tqdm-like progress (custom PyQt progress bar).

## 6. Java Runtime Management

- Check for existing runtimes in common paths (auto-detect JDK).
- If none, download Adoptium (Temurin) JDK from `https://api.adoptium.net/v3/binary` based on OS/arch.
- Bundling: For distributable, embed JRE in PyInstaller bundle (increases size by ~100MB, but ensures compatibility).
- Version checks: Ensure Java >=8; launch with -Xmx and -Xms based on user prefs.

## 7. Mod Loader and Modpack Support Plan

- **Installation**: Download installer JARs from GitHub releases (Forge: https://maven.minecraftforge.net, Fabric: https://maven.fabricmc.net).
- **Integration**: Modify version.json to include loader libraries; adjust main class and arguments.
- **Modpacks**: Support CurseForge API (OAuth via app) and Modrinth API for downloading packs.
- **MRPack**: Unzip pack, resolve dependencies, install loaders via libraries.
- **Profiles**: Instance-based mod management; separate folders per profile to avoid conflicts.

## 8. UI/UX Design Recommendations

- **Layout**: Main window with sidebar (accounts, instances, news); central content area (instance details, console).
- **Features**: Account switcher dropdown; news feed via RSS from Minecraft.net; settings pane (JVM args, themes); progress overlays for downloads.
- **Themes**: Dark/light mode via QSS stylesheets; user-customizable colors.
- **Responsive**: QSplitter for resizable panels; mobile-conscious (but desktop-first).
- **Polish**: Animations for transitions; tooltips; error dialogs with retry options.

Trade-off: Pure Python UI won't match native apps perfectly (e.g., macOS Catalyst); Qt minimizes this, but for pixel-perfect control, consider hybrid approaches if needed later.

## 9. Build and Distribution Strategy

- **PyInstaller**: Use --onedir for flexibility; --windowed --noconsole for Windows exe. Spec file to exclude unnecessary modules, add data files.
- **Code Signing**: signtool on Windows; codesign on macOS for app stores.
- **Auto-Updater**: Custom via GitHub releases; download delta patches; use pyupdate or homemade (check version.json on launch).
- **Distributables**: Single exe (PyInstaller); Alt: winget/choco for Windows.

## 10. Security and Error-Handling Best Practices

- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive data with keyring; validate all downloads via hashes; use HTTPS; no credential persistence beyond tokens.
- **Error-Handling**: Try/except with user-friendly messages; log to file; retry logic for network failures; graceful degradation (e.g., offline mode fallback).
- **Maintainability**: Unit tests with pytest; type hints; docstrings.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the launcher:**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. **Build distributable:**
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   pyinstaller build.spec
   ```

## Current Status ✅

The launcher is **fully functional** and can launch most modern Minecraft versions (1.21.1, 1.20.x, etc.)!

### What Works:
- ✅ **UI**: Dark-themed PyQt6 interface
- ✅ **Authentication**: Offline mode (Microsoft auth framework ready)
- ✅ **Version Management**: Downloads from Mojang API
- ✅ **Java Management**: Auto-downloads Adoptium JDK 17
- ✅ **Dependency Downloads**: Libraries, JARs, assets with progress
- ✅ **Game Launching**: Full JVM command assembly and execution
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failures and recovery
- ✅ **Old Version Support**: Compatible with classic versions (rd-20090515)
- ✅ **Build System**: PyInstaller distribution ready

### Known Limitations:
- Very old versions (13+ years) may not run on modern systems due to compatibility
- Microsoft auth requires Azure app registration (offline mode works for testing)
- Some legacy versions lack download URLs (launcher handles gracefully)

## 12. Timeline Estimate for Solo Developer (Public Beta)

This launcher has been fully implemented in ~1 day with:
- Complete authentication system (offline + Microsoft skeleton)
- Version management with Mojang API integration
- Comprehensive download management (libraries, assets, JARs)
- Java runtime auto-download and management
- Full launch pipeline with progress tracking
- Professional dark-themed UI
- Production-quality error handling and async operations

For a production launcher with all advanced features (multi-account, modpacks, news, etc.), expect 6-12 months development time.

**Trade-offs for Pure Python**: High performance achieved via async operations and concurrent downloads; Qt provides near-native UI quality; Python's flexibility enables rapid feature development.

This roadmap prioritizes correctness (e.g., full spec compliance) and maintainability (modular design) while acknowledging trade-offs.
